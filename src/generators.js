/*
	ES6 Generators
	No more run to completion functions.
	Cooperarive Behavior Special Functions - can be paused in the middle "n" times and resumed later, allowing other functions to run whilst paused.
	Note: In the opposite, a preemptive function can be interrupted abnormally

	Rule 1: In the generator function we can ONLY use the 'yield' keyword as a way to pause the function from its body.
	Rule 2: After paused, the generator function CANNOT resume autmatically, some external control process needs to give that instruction via .next();

	Tip 1: while(true){ ... } can be safely used with generator functions
	Tip 2: Pausing and Resuming a generator creates a HOOK for a 2-way message channel in and out of the generator,
	namely: the controller function sends parameters to generator on the resume, and receiving parameters from the generator at each yield.

	function *myFunction() {  }
